.. _setup_posix_ubuntu_build:

Set up build environment for POSIX platform on Ubuntu :prop:`tool:ubuntu_version`
=================================================================================

Required tools...

* gcc :prop:`tool:gcc_version` or later
* cmake >= :prop:`tool:cmake_version`
* make

For Ubuntu :prop:`tool:ubuntu_version`, the ``apt`` package ``build-essential`` includes ``gcc`` and ``make``. You can install it as follows...

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install build-essential ninja-build

You will also need ``cmake`` version >= :prop:`tool:cmake_version`. To install it, simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install cmake

which (at time of writing) installs ``cmake`` version 3.28.3 on Ubuntu 24.04
Once installed, check ``cmake`` is found and is version :prop:`tool:cmake_version` or higher:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake --version

Once the above tools are installed you should be able to create an image for the POSIX platform.
In the base directory, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake --preset posix
    cmake --build --preset posix

The build files should be written to a new subdirectory named ``build/posix``
and the built executable should be found at ``build/posix/executables/referenceApp/application/Release/app.referenceApp.elf``.
You should be able to run and see output like this in your shell terminal...

.. code-block:: bash

    $ build/posix/executables/referenceApp/application/Release/app.referenceApp.elf
    hello

    ...

Press ``CTRL-C`` should exit the running application.

Now that you can build the code and run it, you can explore the code, make changes and learn how it works.
