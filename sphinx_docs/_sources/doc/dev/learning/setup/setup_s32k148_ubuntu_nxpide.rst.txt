Flash, debug and test serial console on Ubuntu :prop:`tool:ubuntu_version`
==========================================================================

NXP's `S32 Design Studio for S32 Platform <https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/software/automotive-software-and-tools/s32-design-studio-ide/s32-design-studio-for-s32-platform:S32DS-S32PLATFORM>`_
can be used to flash and debug your image while it is running on the
`S32K148 development board <https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards/automotive-development-platforms/s32k-mcu-platforms/s32k148-q176-evaluation-board-for-automotive-general-purpose:S32K148EVB>`_.

Note: those steps are adapted from the `S32 Design Studio for S32 Platform 3.5 Installation Guide <https://www.nxp.com/webapp/Download?colCode=S32DSIG>`_.
It might be useful to refer to it in case you encounter an issue, or if the steps are outdated.

Install S32 Design Studio for S32 Platform
------------------------------------------

To download and install this you will first need to register for a free account with `NXP <https://www.nxp.com/webapp-signup/register>`_.
Note that free activation codes for software you download will be sent to the email account you register with.
Once registered, you can `download S32 Design Studio for S32 Platform from here <https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/software/automotive-software-and-tools/s32-design-studio-ide/s32-design-studio-for-s32-platform:S32DS-S32PLATFORM>`_.
Go to **Downloads**, and click the button next to **S32 Design Studio 3.5 - Windows/Linux**.

Download the linux installer **S32 Design Studio for S32 Platform v.3.5**. This should give you a file: **S32DS.3.5_b220726_linux.x86_64.bin**.

The most recent version of Ubuntu listed as supported in the linux installer's instructions is Ubuntu :prop:`tool:ubuntu_version`.
However, it has been successfully installed on the Desktop version of Ubuntu :prop:`tool:ubuntu_version`
and the steps to achieve this are described below.
Note this assumes you have already set up the build environment described in :doc:`setup_s32k148_ubuntu_build`.

Install prerequisites for S32 Design Studio on Ubuntu :prop:`tool:ubuntu_version`
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Install 32-bit compatibility libraries

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
       sudo apt update
       sudo apt install lib32z1 libncurses5:i386 libncursesw5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 libbz2-1.0:i386 libc6:i386 libx11-6:i386 libxpm4:i386 libusb-0.1-4 libmpfr6:i386


#. Install TCL

   .. code-block:: bash

       sudo apt install tcl


Install S32 Design Studio on Ubuntu :prop:`tool:ubuntu_version`
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

With all the above prerequisites installed, your Ubuntu system is now ready to install S32 Design Studio itself.
In a command shell, in the directory where you downloaded the linux installer, run it:

    .. code-block:: bash

        chmod +x S32DS.3.5_b220726_linux.x86_64.bin
        ./S32DS.3.5_b220726_linux.x86_64.bin

The splash screen for S32 Design Studio should appear, the installer will bring you through install options
(you can leave all the install options at their default values).

Enter the activation code received by email when prompted and chose **Activate Online**
and allow the installer to complete.

If the activation fails, one of the possible reasons for this is incorrect access permissions for the
`/usr/local/share/macrovision` directory created by the installer when a non-default `umask` is set for the root user
in the system. In a command shell, run the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo chmod -R o+rx /usr/local/share/macrovision

Then repeat the activation.

Launch S32 Design Studio
++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can find the launch script under ``<installation_path>/S32DS.3.5/s32ds.sh``.
The installer should also have created a shortcut to it in a subfolder on your Ubuntu Desktop.

Execute ``s32ds.sh`` to launch the S32 Design studio.

You will be prompted with a window for installing extensions. Select **S32K1xx development package**.
Some of the packages will be marked as **Update available**, two examples are highlighted in green in the following picture.
Scroll through the list and select all of those. You can then click on **Install/Update <n> Items(s)**.

Flash and debug in S32 Design Studio for S32 Platform
-----------------------------------------------------

Assuming you have a `S32K148 development board <https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards/automotive-development-platforms/s32k-mcu-platforms/s32k148-q176-evaluation-board-for-automotive-general-purpose:S32K148EVB>`_
and it is connected to your PC via USB, then you can flash your image on the board and debug over USB.
You can create a dummy project in S32 Design Studio for ARM in the default workspace
and then change it to point to the external code and the image created as described in :doc:`setup_s32k148_ubuntu_build`.

1. In S32 Design Studio choose **File -> New -> S32DS Application Project**,
   select the processor **Family S32K1xx -> S32K148** and give the project a name. eg. “**referenceApp**“.
   You can leave all other settings at their default values.

   .. image:: nxpide_create_project_linux.png
      :width: 80%
      :align: center

#. In **Run -> Debug Configurations** find **GDB PEMicro Interface Debugging-> referenceApp_Debug_FLASH_PNE**.
   In the **Main tab** set the **C/C++ Application** to the `.elf` file you should have already built
   as described in :doc:`setup_s32k148_ubuntu_build`.
   Enter the absolute path to the `.elf` file:

   .. code-block::

        [absolute_path_to_project_root]/build/s32k148-gcc/executables/referenceApp/application/RelWithDebInfo/app.referenceApp.elf

   .. image:: nxpide_debug_config_linux.png
      :width: 80%
      :align: center

#. In the **Debugger tab**, in the **Interface:** field select ``OpenSDA Embedded Debug - USB Port``.
   The **Port:** field should then be populated with an instance representing the target board connected to your PC via USB.
   If nothing appears in the **Port:** field you can try pressing **Refresh** or power cycling your target board.
   **If the target board is not found then you cannot continue until this is resolved.**

   .. image:: nxpide_debugger_tab_linux.png
      :width: 80%
      :align: center

#. In the **Source tab** select **Add... -> Absolute File Path**.

   .. image:: nxpide_absolute_path_linux.png
      :width: 80%
      :align: center

#. If the above steps are successful then press the **Debug** button,
   this flashes `app.referenceApp.elf` to the target board and starts the debugger,
   it halts at the entry point in `main()`.
   At this point you can single-step through the code, or press the **Resume** button to run the software.
   Once flashed you can power-cycle the target board without the USB connection and it will run the software.

#. Also in the **Debugger tab**, you will see the GDB Client Settings Executable set to ${S32DS_GDB_ARM32_EXE}.

   If you get the error:
   ``Could not determine GDB version after sending: ~/NXP/S32DS.3.5/eclipse/../S32DS/tools/gdb-arm/arm32-eabi/bin/arm-none-eabi-gdb --version``

   Fix this by running
   ``sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpfr.so.6 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpfr.so.4``


Test the Serial Console
-----------------------

The application running on the board uses the serial port for logging messages and to implement a command console,
which can be interacted with in parallel to debugging over the same USB cable.
This will appear as a `TTY` device in linux. eg. ``/dev/ttyACM0``.
In order to test this you need serial port terminal software to connect to the COM port.

**minicom** is one example of such software - you can install this as follows:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt install minicom

The serial port parameters for the board with the software running are as follows:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1
    :widths: auto

    * - Speed
      - Data
      - Parity
      - Stop bits
      - Flow control
    * - 115200
      - 8 bit
      - None
      - 1
      - None

Assuming the serial port is assigned to the device ``/dev/ttyACM0`` then you can connect with `minicom` as follows:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200

If the target board is powered and the software you built and flashed on the board is running then you should see output from it printed to the console,
and if you type ``help`` you should see the commands available printed out, like this:

   .. code-block:: bash

At this point, you can build the code, flash it on the board and debug it.
You can now explore the code, make your own changes and learn how it works.
