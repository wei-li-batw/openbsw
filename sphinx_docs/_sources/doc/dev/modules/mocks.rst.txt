Mocks
=====

Modules which are platform dependent or configure executables often need to be mocked for unit tests.
To avoid duplicating these mocks, they are collected in the `executables/unitTest` folder.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1
    :glob:

    ../../../executables/unitTest/**/doc/index
